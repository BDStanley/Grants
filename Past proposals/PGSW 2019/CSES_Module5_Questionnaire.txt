COLLABORATOR INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CSES QUESTIONNAIRE:

  ( 1)  Following these collaborator instructions, this document is 
        comprised of three sections:

        ))) CSES MODULE 5 QUESTIONNAIRE: ADMINISTRATIVE VARIABLES

        The "Administrative Variables" section is a list of common
        administrative variables that, if possible, should be provided at
        the time data are deposited with the CSES Secretariat.

        ))) CSES MODULE 5 QUESTIONNAIRE: CSES MODULE

        This is the CSES Module itself, a common module of survey questions
        for researchers to include in their national post-election survey.
        The CSES Module is intended to be administered exactly as it is
        specified in this document.

        ))) CSES MODULE 5 QUESTIONNAIRE: DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES

        Collaborators are asked to provide data on background (demographic)
        characteristics of respondents, coded to an agreed upon set of
        standards as indicated in this section. There is great
        international variation in the ways that collaborators will go
        about soliciting information on the background characteristics of
        their respondents. The objective here is not standardization of the
        way collaborators ask these background questions, but instead,
        standardization to a common, cross-national scheme for coding each
        variable.

  ( 2)  The CSES Module (consisting of the questions which are named 
        beginning with the letter "Q") is intended to be administered in
        its entirety as a single, uninterrupted block of questions, unless 
        noted otherwise for particular questions. In most cases, the CSES 
        Module is included as part of a larger study. For reliable 
        comparisons to be made, it is important that any additional items
        investigators may wish to include do not interrupt the CSES Module.

  ( 3)  The CSES module should be administered as a post-election
        interview.

  ( 4)  Where the CSES module is included in a larger study, to ensure that
        question-ordering effects are minimized, collaborators should be
        sensitive to the effects questions asked immediately prior to the
        module may have.

  ( 5)  NOTES often precede the question TEXT, and provide instructions for
        the administration of the item. Where no question TEXT is provided,
        collaborators should provide documentation of the question used.

  ( 6)  Showcards may be helpful for the administration of some questions.
        For this reason, a Respondent Booklet is available for download
        from the CSES website. The Respondent Booklet contains showcards
        for select questions. It is indicated in the NOTES when a showcard
        is available for a question.
        
  ( 7)  The response options that should be read to the respondent are
        contained in the body of the question TEXT.

  ( 8)  Where lower-case words appear in brackets [ ] collaborators should
        select the words that are most appropriate.

        For example:
        [party/presidential candidate]
        ...indicates that either the word "party" or the phrase
        "presidential candidate" should be read, but not both.

  ( 9)  Where upper-case words appear in brackets [ ] collaborators should
        substitute the words that are most appropriate.

        For example:
        [COUNTRY]
        ...should be replaced with the name of the country where the
        election was held (perhaps "Canada" or "the Philippines").

        Another example:
        [NUMBER OF YEARS BETWEEN THE PREVIOUS AND THE PRESENT ELECTION
        OR CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT]
        ...should be replaced with a number that indicates the amount of
        years that have passed between the previous election and either the
        current election or recent change in government.

  (10)  Phrases that appear in parentheses ( ) contain words that are
        optional - that collaborators (or their interviewers) can decide to
        read or not read to respondents as needed.

  (11)  Words in question text that are in upper-case but NOT within 
        brackets [ ] should be emphasized by the interviewer when reading
        the question text. 
        
        For example, the word "COUNTRY" would be emphasized in the
        following question when the interviewer reads the question to the
        respondent:
        
        What COUNTRY do you live in?
        
        But in this next example, the interviewer does not emphasize the
        word "[COUNTRY]". Instead, this is an instruction for the
        collaborator to substitute the name of the respondent's country
        into the question text (for more information, see the eighth
        Collaborator Instruction above):
        
        How long have you lived in [COUNTRY]?
                        
  (12)  Interviewer instructions are available for some questions. These
        interviewer instructions, labeled as HELP, are intended to
        provide advice to the interviewers to assist in administering the
        question. It is also useful to discuss the interviewer instructions
        as part of interviewer training. The interviewer instructions, 
        where available, appear after the question TEXT. In 
        interviewer-administered surveys, interviewer instructions should
        be available to the interviewer, but not to the respondent. For
        example, in a computer-assisted interview, the interviewer
        instructions might appear on the screen in a special color, and
        interviewers trained to make use of those instructions as
        necessary, but the interviewer should NOT read the interviewer
        instructions to the respondent.
        
  (13)  Some response options are followed by an arrow (->) and a skip
        pattern instruction. If the respondent selects that response 
        option, the skip pattern instruction after the arrow is to be
        executed.

  (14)  Respondents who volunteer the response "DON'T KNOW" (or who have
        REFUSED to answer a question) should be coded as such. Interviewers
        should accept these responses and should NOT probe for additional
        information or force a respondent to use one of the response
        options provided in the text of the question.

  (15)  Special care should be taken in the administration of the Vote 
        Choice items (Q12 and Q13 question series).
        
        Wording for the Q12 and Q13 question series, which is to record
        vote choice in the elections, should follow national standards. 
       
        Collaborators are invited to compare their own national instrument
        with other instruments of countries that are part of the CSES and
        look for convergence where this is possible.
        
        For Q13 (previous election), ask about the previous national 
        election of the same type (whether legislative or presidential).
        For countries where more than one institution is being currently
        elected on the same day (e.g., president and legislature), please 
        consider asking about the previous lower house election if votes
        have been recorded for the current lower house election. 
        
        For Q12 (current election), for countries where more than one 
        institution is elected on the same day (e.g., president and 
        legislature) using different votes, please ensure that all votes
        are supplied. Consider including all national elections having been
        held within three months before the study's data collection period.
        
        Please ensure all vote choices are supplied as separate variables
        in the dataset that you deposit.
        
        For countries where voters have two votes for the same institution
        (e.g. parallel and mixed member proportional systems; double
        ballot systems), please ensure that both/all votes are supplied.
        
        For countries using preferential systems (e.g., STV, AV) please
        provide first and second preference vote.
          
  (16)  For questions asking about parties, collaborators should be advised
        that they may add one or several party blocs to a list of
        individual parties if they feel that it will be difficult for
        respondents to recognize individual parties.

  (17)  Collaborators in the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems shall
        adhere to the following standards of data quality:

        a. Mode of interviewing: Interviews should be conducted
           face-to-face, unless local circumstances dictate that telephone,
           Internet, or mail surveys will produce higher quality data.            
           Mixed-mode surveys are acceptable to increase response rates
           and/or compensate for undercoverage associated with particular
           survey modes. In cases of mode variation as well as in cases of
           within-mode variation (e.g. adaption of Internet surveys to 
           multiple devices) presentation of questionnaires to respondents
           should be as similar as possible. All variation within surveys
           shall be documented in detail, and technical information on
           survey mode and, where appropriate, device used shall be
           identified in the data set for each respondent. National studies
           should seek to keep mode changes to a minimum to maximize
           comparability of their data sets across modules.

        b. Timing of interviewing: We strongly recommend that collaborators
           in the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems conduct their
           interviews in the weeks following their national election. 
           Interviewing should not start later than six months after the
           election. Out of concern for data quality, data collection
           should be completed in as timely a fashion as possible. In the
           event of a runoff election, interviewing shall be conducted 
           after the first round election. The date of interview shall be
           provided for each respondent.

        c. Placement of module in post-election questionnaire: The
           questionnaire module should be asked as a single, uninterrupted
           block of questions. We leave it to each collaborator to select
           an appropriate location for the module in their national survey
           instrument. Collaborators should take steps to ensure that
           questions asked immediately prior to the questionnaire module
           do not contaminate the initial questions in the module.
           Collaborators are also free to select an appropriate place in
           their survey instrument to ask the turnout, vote choice,
           and demographic questions.

        d. Population to be sampled: National samples should be drawn from
           all age-eligible citizens. No sampling frames with systematic 
           undercoverage of significant population groups (such as citizens
           without access to the Internet) are acceptable. When 
           non-citizens (or other non-eligible respondents) are included
           in the sample, a variable should be provided to permit the
           identification of those non-eligible respondents. When a
           collaborator samples from those persons who appear on voter
           registration lists, the collaborator should quantify the 
           estimated degree of discrepancy between this population and the
           population of all age-eligible citizens. Studies based on
           panels or access panels are acceptable if dictated by local
           circumstances. In such cases the collaborator should seek to
           minimize the time lag between initial sampling and the CSES
           survey and quantify the estimated degree of discrepancy to the
           population of all age-eligible citizens and provide weights.
           Details about initial sampling must be documented.

        e. Sampling procedures: We strongly encourage the use of random
           samples, with random sampling procedures used at all stages of
           the sampling process. Collaborators should provide detailed
           documentation of their sampling practices for all stages.

        f. Sample Size: We strongly recommend that no fewer than 1,500
           age-eligible respondents be interviewed, and under no 
           circumstances should fewer than 1,000 age-eligible respondents
           be interviewed.

        g. Interviewer training: Collaborators should pre-test their survey
           instrument and should train interviewers in the administration
           of the questionnaire. The Planning Committee will provide each
           collaborator with documentation that clarifies the purposes and
           objectives of each item and with rules with respect to probing
           "don't know" responses.

        h. Field practices: Collaborators should make every effort to
           ensure a high response rate. Investigators should be diligent in
           their effort to reach respondents not interviewed on the initial
           contact with the household and should be diligent in their
           effort to convert respondents who initially refuse to
           participate in the study. Data on the number of contact
           attempts, the number of contacts with sample persons, and
           special persuasion or conversion efforts undertaken should be
           coded for each respondent.

        i. Strategies for translation (and back-translation): Each
           collaborator should translate the questionnaire module into
           their native language(s). To ensure the equivalence of the
           translation, collaborators shall perform an independent
           re-translation of the questionnaire back into English.
           Collaborators engaged in translation of the questionnaire module
           into the same language (e.g., Spanish, French, English, German,
           and Portuguese) should collaborate on the translation.

Q09.     >>> GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE: GENERAL
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES:   In studies of parliamentary elections, ask about the government.  
         For "in [CAPITAL]" substitute the name of the capital of the
         country where the election was held.

         In studies of presidential elections, ask about the president.
         
         For example, for a presidential election study in an imaginary
         country with capital "XYZ", where the last election was five 
         years ago and the president prior to the election was female,
         the question would read:
         "Now thinking about the performance of the president in 
         general, how good or bad a job do you think the president in
         XYZ has done over the past five years? Has she done a very good 
         job? A good job? A bad job? A very bad job?"

         When substituting a number for the phrase "[NUMBER OF YEARS SINCE 
         LAST GOVERNMENT TOOK OFFICE, BEFORE THE CURRENT ELECTION]" please
         ignore interim/caretaker governments.

NOTES:   In most national contexts, the left-right dimension will be the

         addition to the left-right placement scales.
