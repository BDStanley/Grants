<p class="binderItem"><strong>By Fate or By Choice? Democratic Backsliding versus Democratic Success in Central and Eastern Europe</strong><br/>The main objective of this project is to explain the diverging trajectories of democracy in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). While there are cases in which we can observe a clear continuity of democratic consolidation, in particular Estonia, Czech Republic and Slovenia, in other countries the quality of democracy has experienced a significant decline in recent years, most notably Hungary from 2010 onwards and Poland after the 2015 elections. <br/>

The cases of democratic backsliding in the region d...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>The empirical background</strong><br/>Against a comforting picture of emancipatory ‘freedom rising’ {Welzel:2013wp p.14}, some scholars have begun to argue that citizens of liberal-democratic states are increasingly ‘disaffected with … representative institutions [and] minority rights’, and ‘are increasingly open to authoritarian interpretations of democracy’ {Foa:2017wu p.6}.<br/>
<br/>
The young democracies of Central and Eastern Europe have already yielded several examples of how consolidated democratic regimes can be undermined from withi...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>The theoretical context</strong><br/>In explaining democratic backsliding (and its absence) in CEE, our project will focus on the following typology:<br/>
 <br/>
 • a moderate decline in the quality of democracy, characterised by the deficient functioning of democracy in certain areas;<br/>
 • the persistence of a mixed, or ‘hybrid’ regime, in which well-functioning democratic elements are accompanied by clearly authoritarian solutions;<br/>
 • the total or almost complete collapse of democracy: a change of the system from democratic to non-democratic...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Research questions</strong><br/>Amid these changes, scholars of democracy and democratic practitioners alike are left asking themselves: What went wrong? Why? What can be done about it? Our project emerges from this state of uncertainty: there is still much we need to explain about democratic backsliding in order to be able to understand why it has happened in some countries but not in others. <br/>
<br/>
This project therefore has three core aims: <br/>
 • to provide a better understanding of democratic backsliding as it pertains both to th...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Project description</strong><br/>To answer these questions, we will conduct analyses of distinct political domains that have been consequential for the processes of democratic consolidation, are currently consequential for the processes of democratic backsliding, and are potentially consequential for the furtherance or arresting of backsliding in the coming years. These are the supply-side domain of political parties and associated ideological and policy entrepreneurs, the demand-side domain of voters, and the ‘check and balanc...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Theme 1: The supply side</strong><br/>The first theme of our research project is the role of political elites. The classic conception of the democratic relationship is one of a cycle of representation by which citizens delegate authority to elected officials, who are expected to earn the extension of their mandate to govern through being responsive to the interests of the people {Manin:1997it, Manin:1999wz}. Yet according to an alternative account of the representative dynamic in contemporary democracies, it is elites which socialis...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Theme 2: The demand side</strong><br/>While we expect that elite actions will carry a significant amount of explanatory weight, an analysis of voter attitudes, preferences and behaviour is crucial for an understanding of the attitudinal context in which elites operate. <br/>
<br/>
The first theoretical perspective we will consider concerns the ‘political potentials’ that congregate around the poles of ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ of the processes of globalisation and democratic transition {Kitschelt:1992uz, Kriesi:2006wj}. According to this theory,...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Theme 3: Checks and balances</strong><br/>Political elites do not operate in circumstances of absolute voluntarism; they remain subject to the constraining force of institutions. This theme will focus on the relationship between elites, citizens, and a panoply of institutions whose role is to prevent democratic backsliding. Apart from the electoral nexus that comprises political society, Linz and Stepan {*Linz:1996vn p.14} identified four other ‘arenas’ crucial for the consolidation and persistence of modern democracies.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Gaps in the literature</strong><br/>The literature on democratic transition and consolidation remains predominantly one-directional, focusing on describing and explaining the process by which authoritarian regimes become democratic. This literature is rich both in theoretical insights and comparative findings. By contrast, the literature on democratic backsliding is still a nascent field in both theoretical and empirical terms, particularly with respect to diachronic and comparative analyses. This is unsurprising, as the events we...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Methods, work plan, and outputs</strong><br/>We will employ a multi-method strategy to address each of the three research themes identified above. To answer questions about the supply side, we will conduct qualitative and quantitative content analysis of the political rhetoric and ideological positioning of elites, using key data sources such as the speeches of leaders and the manifestos of political parties. For the analysis of values, attitudes and electoral behaviour of voters over time, we will conduct quantitative analyses of key indi...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Project team, national and international collaboration</strong><br/>The project team consists of Ann-Cathrine Jungar, associate professor at Södertörn University (principal investigator), professor Radosław Markowski and assistant professor Ben Stanley of SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Warsaw, Poland, and a PhD student to be recruited by Södertörn University. All researchers will be financed by the Foundation for Baltic and East European Studies. Jungar will work 50% of full time on the project, Markowski will work 40%, Stanley will work 70...</p>
